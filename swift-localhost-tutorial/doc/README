Introduction: Why Parallel Scripting?
------------------------------------

Swift is a simple scripting language for executing many instances of
ordinary application programs on distributed parallel resources.
Swift scripts run many copies of ordinary programs concurrently, using
statements like this:
-----
foreach protein in proteinList {
  runBLAST(protein);
}
-----
Swift acts like a structured "shell" language. It runs programs
concurrently as soon as their inputs are available, reducing the need
for complex parallel programming.  Swift expresses your workflow in a
portable fashion: The same script runs on multicore computers,
clusters, clouds, grids, and supercomputers.

In this tutorial, you'll be able to first try a few Swift examples
on your local machine, to get a sense of the language.

////
Then in parts 4-6 you'll run similar workflows on cloud
compute nodes, and see how more complex workflows can be expressed
with Swift scripts.

Swift installation
------------------
1. Download the file from http://swiftlang.org/packages/swift-0.95-RC6.tar.gz
2. Extract by running "tar xfz swift-0.95-RC6.tar.gz"
3. Add to PATH by running "export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/swift-0.95-RC6/bin"

Swift tutorial installation
---------------------------
Run the following commands to extract these tutorial scripts.

-----
$ cd $HOME
$ wget http://swiftlang.org/tutorials/localhost/swift-localhost-tutorial.tar.gz
$ tar xvfz swift-localhost-tutorial.tar.gz
$ cd swift-localhost-tutorial
-----

Run the tutorial setup script
-----
$ source setup.sh   # You must run this with "source" !
-----

To check out the tutorial scripts from SVN
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you later want to get the most recent version of this tutorial from
the Swift Subversion repository, do:

-----
$ svn co https://svn.ci.uchicago.edu/svn/vdl2/SwiftTutorials/swift-localhost-tutorial  <TODO: Fix link>
-----

This will create a directory called "swift-localhost-tutorial" which contains all of the
files used in this tutorial.


Simple "science applications" for the workflow tutorial
-------------------------------------------------------

This tutorial is based on two intentionally trivial example programs,
`simulation.sh` and `stats.sh`, (implemented as bash shell scripts)
that serve as easy-to-understand proxies for real science
applications. These "programs" behave as follows.

simulate.sh
~~~~~~~~~~~

The simulation.sh script serves as a trivial proxy for any more
complex scientific simulation application. It generates and prints a
set of one or more random integers in the range [0-2^62) as controlled
by its command line arguments, which are:

-----
$ ./app/simulate.sh --help
./app/simulate.sh: usage:
    -b|--bias       offset bias: add this integer to all results [0]
    -B|--biasfile   file of integer biases to add to results [none]
    -l|--log        generate a log in stderr if not null [y]
    -n|--nvalues    print this many values per simulation [1]
    -r|--range      range (limit) of generated results [100]
    -s|--seed       use this integer [0..32767] as a seed [none]
    -S|--seedfile   use this file (containing integer seeds [0..32767]) one per line [none]
    -t|--timesteps  number of simulated "timesteps" in seconds (determines runtime) [1]
    -x|--scale      scale the results by this integer [1]
    -h|-?|?|--help  print this help
$
-----

All of thess arguments are optional, with default values indicated above as `[n]`.

////
.simulation.sh arguments
[width="80%",cols="^2,10",options="header"]

|=======================
|Argument|Short|Description
|1    |runtime: sets run time of simulation.sh in seconds
|2    |range: limits generated values to the range [0,range-1]
|3    |biasfile: add the integer contained in this file to each value generated
|4    |scale: multiplies each generated value by this integer
|5    |count: number of values to generate in the simulation
|=======================
////

With no arguments, simulate.sh prints 1 number in the range of
1-100. Otherwise it generates n numbers of the form (R*scale)+bias
where R is a random integer. By default it logs information about its
execution environment to stderr.  Here's some examples of its usage:

-----
$ simulate.sh 2>log
       5
$ head -4 log

-----

stats.sh
~~~~~~~~

The stats.sh script serves as a trivial model of an "analysis"
program. It reads N files each containing M integers and simply prints
the\ average of all those numbers to stdout. Similarly to simulate.sh
it logs environmental information to the stderr.

-----
$ ls f*
f1  f2  f3  f4

$ cat f*

$ stats.sh f* 2>log

Basics of the Swift language with local execution
-------------------------------------------------

A Summary of Swift in a nutshell
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Swift scripts are text files ending in `.swift` The `swift` command
runs on any host, and executes these scripts. `swift` is a Java
application, which you can install almost anywhere.  On Linux, just
unpack the distribution `tar` file and add its `bin/` directory to
your `PATH`.

* Swift scripts run ordinary applications, just like shell scripts
do. Swift makes it easy to run these applications on parallel and
remote computers (from laptops to supercomputers). If you can `ssh` to
the system, Swift can likely run applications there.

* The details of where to run applications and how to get files back
and forth are described in configuration files separate from your
program. Swift speaks ssh, PBS, Condor, SLURM, LSF, SGE, Cobalt, and
Globus to run applications, and scp, http, ftp, and GridFTP to move
data.

* The Swift language has 5 main data types: `boolean`, `int`,
`string`, `float`, and `file`. Collections of these are dynamic,
sparse arrays of arbitrary dimension and structures of scalars and/or
arrays defined by the `type` declaration.

* Swift file variables are "mapped" to external files. Swift sends
files to and from remote systems for you automatically.

* Swift variables are "single assignment": once you set them you can't
change them (in a given block of code).  This makes Swift a natural,
"parallel data flow" language. This programming model keeps your
workflow scripts simple and easy to write and understand.

* Swift lets you define functions to "wrap" application programs, and
to cleanly structure more complex scripts. Swift `app` functions take
files and parameters as inputs and return files as outputs.

* A compact set of built-in functions for string and file
manipulation, type conversions, high level IO, etc. is provided.
Swift's equivalent of `printf()` is `tracef()`, with limited and
slightly different format codes.

* Swift's `foreach {}` statement is the main parallel workhorse of the
language, and executes all iterations of the loop concurrently. The
actual number of parallel tasks executed is based on available
resources and settable "throttles".

* In fact, Swift conceptually executes *all* the statements,
expressions and function calls in your program in parallel, based on
data flow. These are similarly throttled based on available resources
and settings.

* Swift also has `if` and `switch` statements for conditional
execution. These are seldom needed in simple workflows but they enable
very dynamic workflow patterns to be specified.

We'll see many of these points in action in the examples below. Lets
get started!

Part 1: Run a single application under Swift
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The first swift script, p1.swift, runs simulate.sh to generate a
single random number. It writes the number to a file.

image::part01.png["p1 workflow",align="center"]

.p1.swift
-----
sys::[cat ../part01/p1.swift]
-----


To run this script, run the following command:
-----
$ cd part01
$ swift p1.swift
Swift 0.95 Branch SVN swift-r7903 cog-r3908
RunID: run001
Progress: Tue, 03 Jun 2014 15:01:28-0500
Final status:Tue, 03 Jun 2014 15:01:29-0500  Finished successfully:1
$ cat sim.out
      84
$ swift p1.swift
$ cat sim.out
      36
-----

To cleanup the directory and remove all outputs (including the log
files and directories that Swift generates), run the cleanup script
which is located in the tutorial PATH:

-----
$ cleanup
------

NOTE: You'll also find a Swift configuration files in each `partNN`
directory of this tutorial.  These specify the environment-specific
details of where to find application programs and where to run them .
These files will be explained in more detail in parts 4-6, and can
be ignored for now.

////
It defines
things like the work directory, the scheduler to use, and how to
control parallelism. The sites.xml file below will tell Swift to run
on the local machine only, and run just 1 task at a time.

.swift.properties
-----
sys::[cat ../part01/swift.properties]
-----

 In this case, it
indicates that the app "simulate" (the first token in the command line
declaration of the function `simulation`, at line NNN) is located in the file
simulate.sh and (since the path `simulate.sh` is specified with no
directory components) Swift expects that the `simulate.sh` executable
will be available in your $PATH.

////

Part 2: Running an ensemble of many apps in parallel with a "foreach" loop
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `p2.swift` script introduces the `foreach` parallel iteration
construct to run many concurrent simulations.

image::part02.png[align="center"]

.p2.swift
-----
sys::[cat ../part02/p2.swift]
-----

The script also shows an
example of naming the output files of an ensemble run. In this case, the output files will be named
`output/sim_N.out`.

In part 2, we update the swift.properties file.

Instead of using shell script (simulate is a link to simulate.sh), we use the equivalent
python version (simulate.py). Swift does not need to know anything about the language an
application is written in. The application can be written in Perl, Python, Java, Fortran,
or any other language.

The swift.properties file also defines properties that control the parallelism involved
in the swift execution. By setting the tasksPerWorker to the desired number of parallel
application invocations it is possible to take advantage of multiple cores in the
processor. The taskThrottle variable is used to limit number of tasks sent to
workers for execution. Both tasksPerWorker and taskThrottle are set to 2 in the tutorial
and could be set to the number of cores available on your machine.

-----
sys::[cat ../part02/swift.properties]
-----


To run the script and view the output:
-----
$ cd ../part02
$ swift p2.swift
$ ls output
sim_0.out  sim_1.out  sim_2.out  sim_3.out  sim_4.out  sim_5.out  sim_6.out  sim_7.out  sim_8.out  sim_9.out
$ more output/*

      82
-----

Part 3: Analyzing results of a parallel ensemble
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After all the parallel simulations in an ensemble run have completed,
its typically necessary to gather and analyze their results with some
kind of post-processing analysis program or script.  p3.swift
introduces such a postprocessing step. In this case, the files created
by all of the parallel runs of `simulation.sh` will be averaged by by
the trivial "analysis application" `stats.sh`:

image::part03.png[align="center"]

.p3.swift
----
sys::[cat ../part03/p3.swift]
----

To run:
----
$ cd part03
$ swift p3.swift
----

Note that in `p3.swift` we expose more of the capabilities of the
`simulate.sh` application to the `simulation()` app function:

-----
app (file o) simulation (int sim_steps, int sim_range, int sim_values)
{
  simulate "--timesteps" sim_steps "--range" sim_range "--nvalues" sim_values stdout=filename(o);
}
-----

`p3.swift` also shows how to fetch application-specific values from
the `swift` command line in a Swift script using `arg()` which
accepts a keyword-style argument and its default value:

-----
int nsim   = toInt(arg("nsim","10"));
int steps  = toInt(arg("steps","1"));
int range  = toInt(arg("range","100"));
int values = toInt(arg("values","5"));
-----

Now we can specify that more runs should be performed and that each should run for more timesteps, and produce more that one value each, within a specified range, using command line arguments placed after the Swift script name in the form `-parameterName=value`:

-----
$ swift p3.swift -nsim=3 -steps=10 -values=4 -range=1000000

Part 4: Specifying more complex workflow patterns
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

p4.swift expands the workflow pattern of p3.swift to add additional
stages to the workflow. Here, we generate a dynamic seed value that
will be used by all of the simulations, and for each simulation, we
run an pre-processing application to generate a unique "bias
file". This pattern is shown below, followed by the Swift script.

image::part06.png[align="center"]

.p4.swift
----
sys::[cat ../part04/p4.swift]
----

Note that the workflow is based on data flow dependencies: each simulation depends on the seed value, calculated in this statement:
-----
seedfile = genseed(1);
-----
and on the bias file, computed and then consumed in these two dependent statements:
-----
  biasfile = genbias(1000, 20, simulate_script);
  (simout,simlog) = simulation(steps, range, biasfile, 1000000, values, simulate_script, seedfile);
-----

To run:
----
$ cd ../part04
$ swift p4.swift
----

The default parameters result in the following execution log:

-----
$ swift p4.swift

Each sim_N.out file is the sum of its bias file plus newly "simulated" random output scaled by 1,000,000:

-----

-----

We produce 20 values in each bias file. Simulations of less than that
number of values ignore the unneeded number, while simualtions of more
than 20 will use the last bias number for all remoaining values past
20.  As an exercise, adjust the code to produce the same number of
bias values as is needed for each simulation.  As a further exercise,
modify the script to generate a unique seed value for each simulation,
which is a common practice in ensemble computations.

Performing larger Swift runs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To test with larger runs, provide suitable command line arguments.
The example below will run 1000 simulations with each simulation
taking 5 seconds.
